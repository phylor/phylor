## Hi there 👋

- I'm a web developer specialised on 💎 [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)
- I founded [metikular.ch](https://metikular.ch) — offering software consulting and the development of web applications. We focus on «sophisticated simplicity», i.e. software which is easy to use, but still sophisticated in the background.
- I strive for longterm maintainability of software. Code should be easy to read — less code is often better code, but [code golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com) is not.
- ⌨ [Linux](https://archlinux.org) is my daily driver and my desktop is highly optimised to my workflow. I try to use open-source software wherever possible. [vim](https://www.vim.org) is my programming editor of choice, just because it's fast and I can keep my hands on the keyboard, instead of moving to the mouse continuously.
- 😺 My cat is [helping me out at work every day](https://metikular.ch/en/blogs/moonlander)
- Find out [more about my philosophy](https://metikular.ch/en/pages/about_us)

☎️ Interested in working with me? Contact me at [metikular.ch](https://metikular.ch).

### Projects

- I'm working on [dossier.pet](https://dossier.pet/), an online health dossier for your pets
- I'm the webmaster and developer of [katzenhaus-freunde.ch](https://katzenhaus-freunde.ch), an organisation helping out cats in need (in German only)
